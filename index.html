        <ol start="24">
            <li>"Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: </li>
            <li>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</li>
            <li>But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: </li>
            <li>and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall."</li>

        <h4>Interpretation: </h4>
        <p>The Scripture portion started with 'therefore'. Go through the above relevant Scripture.</p>
        <h4 class="Scripture">Matthew 7:13-23</h4>
        <ol start="13">
            <li>"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it.</li>
            <li>Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.</li>
            <li>Because of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</li>
            <li>You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles?</li>
            <li>Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</li>
            <li>A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.</li>
            <li>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</li>
            <li>Therefore by their fruits you will know them.</li>
            <li>Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.</li>
            <li>Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?'</li>
            <li>And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I felt lead by the Spirit of God to read about the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
        <h4 class="Scripture">Galatians 5:22-23</h4>
        <ol start="22">
            <li>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, </li>
            <li>gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law.</li>
        </ol>
